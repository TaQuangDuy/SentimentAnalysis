I ordered these over-the-ear headphones because my Samsung eat buds were never comfortable for me and they would often fall out of my ear, which is really a problem when that happens on a plane and the darn things rolls to who knows where under someone else's seat! Well, I just decided to forget about stupid ear buds and just get a set of over-the-ear noise canceling headphones. I was not about to shell out big bucks for them because I didn't think I would use them so much, mostly just when I'm traveling. So I looked over many options in the under $50 range and I chose these. I received them same day from Amazon. That was awesome! I opened the box, charged them fully in 2 hours. The usb to usb-c cord is included but you have to supply your own electrical power plug to plug it into a wall outlet to get the fastest charging. It also came with a 3.5mm audio cable as well. Pairing with my phone's Bluetooth was super easy, just follow the little instruction booklet. I started playing some music and I was so happy with the sound. These particular headphones have other great features like sound mode selection and the ability to turn off the noise canceling feature if you need to be able to hear the ambient sound around you while using them. Great Value for someone who's looking for comfort and good performance at a great price!"

2,"I'm not an audiophile, so I am not very knowledgeable on what sounds the best. But these headphones have great bass and clear tones making it easy to hear lyrics or audio books. The noise canceling is awesome, and the pass through mode amplifies sounds so you can hear better than normal while still listening to your media.Bluetooth connectivity is great and easy to set up on multiple devices. Range is decent. Battery lasts for hours and hours, I never drained them so I don't know how long I could go but it was at least 6 with constant noise canceling and media.The con is that they are cheaply made. Only had ours for a few months, and my son leaned over to pick something up and they fell off his head and broke. The clips holding the ear cup snapped. No way to repair it since they use 6 small plastic clips to hold it on, and two of them broke off.Overall for the price these are a great value and if you are careful they should last a long time."

4,"Literally had to write this review after getting my hands on these headphones. For under thirty bucks delivered to your door, you get a very capable Bluetooth headset. Countless hours searching various forums and social media suggestions brought me nowhere close to what these do for a fraction of the price of most.  These are easily the equivalent to lower end Anker Soundcore headphones (which isn't saying much) but I can see where they saved costs comparatively. Unlike other headphones, these don't have an APP you can use to change EQ settings or store custom ones. You also don't get a carrying case with these either, just the headphones themselves. ANC is really basic; enough to muffle everything around you but not precisely filter out any range specifically. Build quality is ""solid but plastic"", typical of headphones sub $80. Fit is a bit small too, but not uncomfortable at all.Another reviewer complained about the bass these push out, but I had no issues with it. It's a default flat sound curve, and mids were especially pronounced. I think the other reviewer was looking for V-shaped phones specifically, but that's understandable and a personal preference. These are excellent for podcasts or audiobooks if you're into that. The bass response does have a little bit of awkwardness in it (fade loud then soft), so bass heads might want to try something else if that's what they're really looking for (I suggest the new Anker H30i - cheap and cheerful heavy bass response)Either way these are a real bargain. I'm thinking of picking up a backup pair in another color."
